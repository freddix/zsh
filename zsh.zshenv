# /etc/zshenv is sourced on all invocations of the
# shell, unless the -f option is set.  It should
# contain commands to set the command search path,
# plus other important environment variables.
# .zshenv should not contain commands that produce
# output or assume the shell is attached to a tty.
#
# Notice: .zshenv is the same, execpt that it's not read
# if zsh is started with -f
#
# Global Order: zshenv, zprofile, zshrc, zlogin
